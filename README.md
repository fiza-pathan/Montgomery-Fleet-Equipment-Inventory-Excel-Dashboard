# Montgomery Fleet Equipment Inventory Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the Montgomery Fleet Equipment Inventory to derive actionable insights and improve fleet management. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and the creation of an interactive dashboard using Excel.

## Objective
The primary objective is to clean and analyze the dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can aid decision-making. This includes creating visualizations and an interactive dashboard to present the findings effectively.

## Dataset Description
The dataset was sourced from Montgomery Fleet Equipment Inventory records. It includes various attributes such as:

- Department
- Equipment Class
- Count of Equipment

## Project Files
The repository contains the following files:

- `Montgomery Fleet Equipment Inventory.xlsx`: Excel file containing the original data, cleaned data, various analyses, and the interactive dashboard.
- `Montgomery Fleet Equipment Inventory.png`: Image of the final dashboard.

## Data Cleaning Process
- Removed duplicates to ensure data integrity.
- Handled missing values appropriately to avoid skewing the analysis.
- Corrected inconsistencies in data entry for accurate analysis.

## Data Analysis
Excel was used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Pivot tables and formulas were utilized for in-depth analysis. Key findings include:

- Total equipment count by class.
- Distribution of equipment classes.
